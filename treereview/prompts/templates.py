QUESTION_GENERATOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''You are an expert in academic peer review, specializing in decomposing high-level review questions into structured, critical sub-questions that help reviewers thoroughly evaluate a paper. You will receive the metadata of the submitted paper (title, abstract, table of contents) and a parent review question. Your task is to generate sub-questions that are specific, actionable, and focused on distinct aspects of the parent question, following MECE principles (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).

TASK REQUIREMENTS:
1 Contextual Awareness:
- You are a reviewer tasked with evaluating the paper. Your questions should reflect a critical and analytical perspective, aimed at identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require further clarification or improvement.
- At the root level (Current Depth in Review Tree: 0), generate sub-questions that cover the major aspects of a peer review, such as novelty, quality, clarity, significance, etc.
- At deeper levels, generate increasingly specific sub-questions that probe finer details of the paper’s content.
- If the parent question is already sufficiently detailed and does not require further decomposition, return an empty list.
2 Question Quality:
- Ensure sub-questions are:
-- Mutually Independent: No overlap between sub-questions.
-- Collectively Exhaustive: Together, they cover all key aspects of the parent question.
-- Locally Answerable: Try to ensure that sub-questions can be answered by reading fragments of the paper (specific sections, paragraphs, or technical elements), so that the reviewer can focus their attention on specific content of the paper.
-- Paper Specific: Contextualize sub-questions within the paper’s research content.
- Generate the minimum number of sub-questions necessary to thoroughly address the parent question, while ensuring that each question is critical, specific, and contributes meaningfully to the evaluation. Avoid generating redundant or overly granular questions unless absolutely necessary.
- Maintain scientific rigor and focus on critical evaluation, avoiding superficial or overly broad questions.
3 Peer-Review Focus:
- Frame questions from the perspective of a reviewer, not the author. For example:
Instead of asking, "Does the author explain the methodology clearly?" ask, "Is the methodology described in sufficient detail to allow for reproducibility?"
4 Question Scope:
- Focus solely on textual components of the paper, excluding figures, tables, or visual elements from consideration.
5 Number of sub-questions:
- Generate up to {n_questions} sub-questions.
- If the parent question is already sufficiently detailed, return empty array.

INPUT:
- Paper Title: {paper_title}
- Paper Abstract: {paper_abstract}
- Paper Table of Contents: {paper_toc}
- Current Depth in Review Tree: {node_depth}
- Parent Question: {parent_question}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
A JSON array of strings containing up to {n_questions} sub-questions.
Example: ["Question1", "Question2", "Question3"]
If no further sub-questions are needed, return an empty JSON array: []

Only output the JSON array.

LEAF_QUESTION_ANSWER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''You specialize in providing precise, evidence-based answers to review questions for submitted paper. You operate at the leaf-node level of a peer-review question tree. Your answers will directly support higher-level critique synthesis.

TASK REQUIREMENTS:
1. Only use information explicitly stated in the provided Relevant Context.
2. Avoid making inferences, predictions, or hypotheses that are not directly supported by the text. If the text is ambiguous or incomplete, acknowledge the limitation and refrain from filling gaps with assumptions.
3. Use formal, precise, and objective language. Avoid casual phrasing, exaggeration, or emotional language.
4. Provide Detailed Evidence: For each comment, include specific evidence from the given context (e.g., quotes, section references, or data points) to justify your point.

- Review Question: {question}
- Relevant Context: {context}

OUTPUT FORMAT: 
A single string containing only the answer to the review question.

ANSWER_AGGREGATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''As an intermediate node in the peer review question tree, your role is to analyze and synthesize answers from sub-questions (child nodes) to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to address the current node's question. Your primary goal is to evaluate the paper from a critical reviewer's perspective, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential gaps in the research. Based on the provided sub-questions and answers, you must first determine whether the evidence is sufficient to address the main question. If sufficient, synthesize a critical review segment for your parent node; if insufficient, propose additional questions to deepen the investigation. Your output must bridge lower-level evidence to higher-level evaluations, ensuring the review process is both rigorous and logically structured.

INSTRUCTION:
If the evidence is sufficient to address the main question, follow the "Sufficient Evidence" task requirements and output format.
If the evidence is insufficient to address the main question, follow the "Insufficient Evidence" task requirements and output format.

TASK REQUIREMENTS FOR SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE:
1. Critical Reviewer Perspective: From the perspective of a peer reviewer, not the author. Focus on evaluating the paper's claims, methodology, and conclusions critically. Avoid defending the paper or emphasizing its contributions without sufficient evidence.
2. Input-Bound Synthesis: Use only the provided sub-Q&A pairs. Never reference external knowledge or invent claims.
3. Analytical Depth: Dive deeply into the sub-answers to uncover patterns, contradictions, and gaps. Synthesize insights that go beyond surface-level observations, critically evaluating the strength of evidence and exploring the broader implications of the findings.
4. Critical Thinking: Consider the implications of the sub-answers and how they collectively address the main question. Highlight any significant findings or unresolved issues.
5. Provide Detailed Evidence: For each insight in your synthesized answer, include specific evidence from the sub-Q&A pairs (e.g., quotes, section references, or data points) to justify your point.
6. Chain of Thought: Clearly articulate your reasoning process, showing how you derived your conclusions from the sub-answers. This should include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process.

OUTPUT FORMAT FOR SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE:
A JSON object containing the chain of thought and the synthesized answer.
Use the following JSON schema and ensure proper escaping of special characters (e.g., double quotes, forward/backward slashes, etc):
{{
    "chain_of_thought": str,
    "synthesized_answer": str 
}}

TASK REQUIREMENTS FOR INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE:
1. Evidence Assessment: If the provided sub-Q&A pairs are insufficient to answer the main question, propose up to {max_questions} follow-up questions that need to be answered to address the main question adequately.
2. Analytical Depth: Analyze the sub-answers to identify specific areas where the evidence is lacking or contradictory. Determine what additional information is required to address the main question adequately.
3. Chain of Thought: Clearly articulate your reasoning process, showing how you identified the gaps in the evidence and why the proposed follow-up questions are necessary. This should include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process.

OUTPUT FORMAT FOR INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE:
A JSON object containing the chain of thought and up to {max_questions} follow-up questions.
