            "Summary": "The authors present a transformer model for forecasting and anomaly detection. The model performs both forecasting and reconstruction in the frequency domain with a fraction of parameters compared to state-of-the-art transformers. The model demonstrates impressive performance on anomaly detection and forecasting tasks.",
            "Strengths": "1. This is an interesting work and novel to the best of my knowledge.    2. I strongly believe that the lightweight nature of the model is an asset.    3. The model demonstrates near state-of-the-art performance.    4. The paper is well-written.",
            "Weaknesses": "Major: Most of these are not deal breakers, but the following would make the evaluation of the model stronger:\n   1. Baselines for forecasting : The authors compare with only transformer based models. I would encourage the authors to compare with advanced non-transformer based models such as N-HiTS [1] and N-BEATS [2].    2. Handling of multi-variate time-series data (see Q1)   3. Baselines for anomaly detection: I would again encourage the authors to compare with state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection e.g., DGHL [3].    4. Evaluation for anomaly detection detection: I would encourage the authors to use standard evaluation metrics for anomaly detection like adjusted best F1 [3, 4], Average Precision [4, 5], and Volume Under Surface (VUS) [6]. The datasets used also have known flaws [7].\n Minor:\n   1. \"To avoid information leakage, We choose\" --> \"To avoid information leakage, we choose\"\n References:\n   1.

            "Summary": "This paper proposes an impressive compact model, named FITS, for time series tasks, including forecasting and anomaly detection. FITS achieves manipulation to time series through interpolation in the frequency domain. The whole framework is quite simple and has remarkably few parameters. FITS achieves competitive performance to SOTA baselines on both forecasting and anomaly detection with about 50 times fewer parameters. With such impressive performance, the proposed model would have a certain impact on the community.",
            "Strengths": "1. The idea of implementing time series forecasting and anomaly detection through interpolation in frequency domain is interesting and technically sound.   2. Detailed designs, including LPF and utilization of RevIN, are well motivated and described, making the whole framework reasonable and easy to follow.   3. The proposed model achieves impressive performance on both forecasting and anomaly detection with a remarkably compact size.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. Lack of time consumption analysis. Due to rFFT and irFFT in the model, time efficiency is the main concern.    2. The coverage of related works is barely satisfactory. Adding some preliminary about manipulation in frequency domain to the manuscript would be helpful to understand the model.   3. Typos. For example, duplicated citations in line 383 and line 385.",
            "Questions": "1. It is appreciated to further list time consumption of the proposed model under different settings and compare time efficiency with baselines.   2. For forecasting task, what if the model is supervised in frequency domain?    3. Did authors try other interpolation methods, e.g., convolution?",

            "Summary": "This paper proposed a novel method on time-series forecasting and anomaly detection. The solution relies on the frequency-domain feature of the given time series and proposes to use a linear model to interpolate the data in the frequency domain. After that, the model utilizes the inverse FFT operation to transform the frequency domain data into time domain. The interpolated time series is longer than the original one. Thus, the forecasting has been conducted based on the augmented time series sequence.",
            "Strengths": "1. The idea is novel. The interpolation of the time series in the frequency domain provides some insights for this community.\n   2. The model efficiency is quite amazing, only 10K parameters have provided the comparable even better performance for the time-series prediction task.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. The experiments are not promising. What's the number of the random runs and did you control the random seeds? I suggest to report the mean and std values of the results.\n   2. As this is the new architecture of the time-series model, more analysis should be conducted such as more prediction tasks, more ablation studies for the key components of the method, etc.\n   3. The reason behind the effectiveness of the proposed method remains unclear to me.",
            "Questions": "N/A.",
            "Limitations": "See those in weakness part.\n Moreover, the augmented time series is not appropriate for the forecasting tasks. Forecasting is the extension for one given time series, however, simply interpolating for augmenting the original time series is not intuitively correct, because it has modified the original data piece rather than prediction upon the given information (in time domain). And the experimental results show that the performance is not comparable to the baseline methods such as PatchTST. I suggest the authors to further improve the method and figure out the reason of its effectiveness.",

            "Summary": "This paper builds a model for time series learning in the frequency domain. The key idea is to discard high-frequency components to reduce the model size. This leads to a simple model under 10k parameters, 50x smaller than DLinear. Experimental results suggest the model can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on long-term forecasting tasks and several anomaly detection tasks.",
            "Strengths": "1. Transforming time series into a frequency domain and then training a model is an interesting idea.   2. The model is extremely small, even 50X smaller than DLinear, which is already very small.   3. The experiments on long-term forecasting are strong.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. It is unclear whether the approach has practical value. DLinear could be already sufficiently small to fit in a normal edge device. Thus, it is not persuading to have an even smaller model.   2. Training efficiency is not reported.   3. The experiments on anomaly detection are not strong. Firstly, all the baselines are neural networks. However, traditional methods like OCSVM and IForest can have strong performance [1]. Secondly, the existing anomaly detection datasets could be flawed. Thus, I am particularly interested to know how the proposed method performs in the synthetic data provided in [1]. The pattern-wise outliers in [1] are synthesized by modifying the sinusoidal waves. Thus, the proposed method seems to well align with the design of this dataset. I am curious how it performs on this dataset.\n [1] Revisiting Time Series Outlier Detection: Definitions and Benchmarks",

Can the proposed method outperform classical anomaly detection methods, such as OCSVM and IForest?   3.

            "Summary": "The authors introduce FITS, a lightweight model for time series analysis. Unlike existing models that process raw time-domain data directly, FITS operates on the principle of manipulating time series through interpolation in the complex frequency domain. By discarding high-frequency components that have a negligible impact on the time series data, FITS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models for time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. Additionally, FITS has a remarkably compact size, consisting of only approximately 10k parameters. This lightweight model is mainly constituted by a simple Complex-valued Linear Layer functioning on frequency domain.",
            "Strengths": "* About the presentation: Straight-forward to follow, simple and direct sentences.   * About the contribution: The proposed FITS framework is very light-weighted, since its learning parameters mainly coming from 1 dense layer. This contribution make its great application for actual real-world scenarios, applying on edge devices. The natural idea about _Low Pass Filter_ is not new, but is used with good reasoning.   * About the experiment: Authors illustrate the effectivenesses of FITS with two main time series tasks: Forecasting and detecting anomaly. While these experiments are not extensive, it effectively support the contributions the authors claim: Comparative performance and much more lightweight compared to existing SOTAs.",
            "Weaknesses": "* About the presentation: Figure 1 has some too dim colors and hard to see; Figure 2 is also quite small, the font size should be increased.   * About the contribution:     * Details about input or output dimensions are not discussed (only discuss about the temporal axis). It is not clear whether the framework can be applied to multivariate series? How to choose cutoff frequency in case of multivariate series, when the harmonics are likely to be different over different variables?     * While the different components constituting FITS are used with clear intentions, these techniques or algorithms (rFFT, RIN, low-pass filter, \u2026) are not new and even well established.     * The experiments for both time series and anomaly detection tasks suggest the framework has a great variance when evaluating on different datasets. In general, FITS cannot achieve SOTA performance in many scenarios, which may be unsuitable for performance-critical applications.",
            "Questions": "* Are there any plans to enhance the visibility of the figure, perhaps by adjusting the colors, the font size, or using a different visualization technique?   * Can the proposed framework be extended to handle multivariate time series? If so, how do you choose the cutoff frequency when the harmonics are likely to differ across different variables?",
            "Limitations": "Authors recognize following weaknesses:\n   * FITS struggles with binary-valued time series and time series with missing data.   * Binary-valued time series are better suited for time-domain modeling due to their compact raw data format.   * For time series with missing data, a two-step approach is suggested: apply simple time-domain imputation techniques before utilizing FITS for analysis.\n The authors should consider amend the weaknesses mentioned above if possible or make some modifications to the manuscripts to rebuttal the comments.",
