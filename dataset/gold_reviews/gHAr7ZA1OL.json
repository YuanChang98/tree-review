        "Metareview": "Dear Authors,\n Thank you for submitting your draft. Most of the reviews are on the slightly positive side (3,6,6). However, concern remains regarding the contribution, which we believe could be attributed to the writing. We encourage authors to improve readability to make contribution and methodology more clear.\n Authors have stated in their rebuttal that \"recent researches have shown that the amplitude and phase could be separately regarded as the style and content of the input\", however, the work they cite are \" Lee et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2021); Oppenheim & Lim (1981)\" indicating this information might not be just recent. A simple rephrasing shall clarify this.\n We also encourage authors to further clarify in their final copy, how the \"diffusion\" term being used in their draft is different from the general use of this term nowadays.\n Regards\n Meta review",
        "Justification For Why Not Higher Score": "Rank is only slightly positive. Paper's writing style could be improved. Sitting in Dec. 2023 their comparisons look old.",
        "Justification For Why Not Lower Score": "An interesting problem. One reviewer who questioned novelty, still was not\ninterested in decreasing rank, indicating reviewer found the paper somewhat\ninteresting."

            "Summary": "This paper focuses on the out-of-distribution object detection (OOD-OD) task, and proposes a method named MPD to tackle it from the frequency perspective. Following the previous method VOS that alleviates the OOD-OD problem by adaptively synthesizing virtual outliers, MPD also attempts to synthesize suitable virtual OOD features as well as generate augmented features for supervised training. Different from VOS that assumes a class-conditional multivariate Gaussian distribution of the feature space, MPD in this paper tries to add noise to the phase domain in the diffusion way. Moreover, the authors find that the Gaussian Average for processing each step is better than directly adding noise. Many experiments and ablation studies have verified that MPD is superior than previous methods for dealing with OOD-OD.",
            "Strengths": "I think this paper has at least the following several major contributions:\n   1. The authors approach the OOD-OD problem from the phase domain of the extracted image features, which is an aspect that is interesting and rarely studied.\n   2. Introducing diffusion to generate different features is a new attempt in OOD. After discovering that simply and directly adding noise according to the original method was problematic, the authors proposed their own effective improvement strategies.\n   3. Quantitative experimental results prove the advancement of MPD in many OOD-OD benchmarks.",
            "Weaknesses": "Similarly, we summarize the weaknesses of this paper as follows:\n   1. Actually, studying the processing of features from a phase perspective is not the first of its kind in this paper. In other words, the method [1] has proven that phase-related features are content-oriented in the DG field, which is very similar to OOD. This paper directly uses such a conclusion of DG in OOD and cannot be regarded as a complete innovation.\n   2. Generally speaking, there are quite a few steps in the continuous transformation of the Diffusion model, such as dozens or even hundreds of steps. The method in this paper seems to only use up to 4 interations (T=4 in Table 5). Why not try more steps? Is it because more parameters are introduced (such as the U-Net model for predicting feature maps, and two branches for generating new features in OOD) that it is inconvenient to increase T to a too large number? If so, the authors need to explain clearly how the new method MPD increases the number of parameters compared to the original basic detector, such as the used Faster R-CNN.\n   3. As we all know, Faster R-CNN is a classic but outdated detector. It gives a weak baseline of detection comparing to recent new ones. The actual value of OOD-OD is to achieve robust and generalizable object detection in real applications. Thus, using advanced basic detectors such as YOLOv5 [2], YOLOv8 [3], TOOD [4] and DETRs is more meaningful. And it will be important to see if the proposed MPD works or not on these superior detectors. It may not be practical to do more experiments. The authors could give similar explanations and discussions. For example, is MPD universal to these superior detectors?\n [1] Decompose, Adjust, Compose: Effective Normalization by Playing With Frequency for Domain Generalization, CVPR 2023\n [2] <https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5>, YOLOv5 2020\n [3] <https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics>, YOLOv8 2023\n [4] TOOD: Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection, ICCV 2021",
            "Questions": "Overall, the method proposed in this paper is innovative and effective. Please go back to the two questions I mentioned in the weaknesses of items 2 and 3. Let me shorten these two questions as below:\n   1. How the proposed MPD increases the number of network parameters?   2. How about using advanced basic detectors instead of the outdated Faster R-CNN?",

            "Summary": "This paper focuses on the OOD object detection problem and propose to detect unknown object without relying on auxiliary OOD data. This paper exploits ID data to generate OOD data by considering the phase information in frequency spectrum. A modulated phase diffusion (MPD) is designed, with some detailed forward and reverse compuation. Experiments on several tasks show the effectiveness.",
            "Strengths": "+The proposed technical framework sounds good, by leveraging frequency information, U-net and augmented features.\n   * Experimental results are comparable to previous SOTA models.",
            "Weaknesses": "* This paper writting has a large space for improvement and not easy to follow. Although the authors presented the main motivations of this paper, there are still many places unclear. The phase information of ID features is used to generate OOD features. Since phase represents more the content, the amplititude information may be more important for different styles (OOD featuers). -The motivation on the augmented features (ID or OOD?) is not estabilished. -What is the difference between OOD-OD and open-set OD? The authors seem list them as different. But as I see, they are the same problem. -The forward and reverse process are not clear due to the poor writting. -Fig.1 and Fig.2 are redundant which evens show similar objective about the proposed MPD. Also, the designed method seems complex and not easy to follow. -I also concern about the claim \"lacking unknown data\". Since OOD-OD is problem setting, it is rational to suppose some categories are unknown, such as open-set OD. -Lacking the visualization results of phase based OOD data synthesis.",
            "Questions": "1. How about the conventional unknown object detection based on a simple threshold, such as entropy based.   2. Minimizing the KL between ID and OOD is strange in Eq. 7.   3. In Eq. 9, there are many losses, which makes the training not easy.",

            "Summary": "This manuscript attempts to use the Diffusion model to solve the unsupervised out-of-distribution object detection (OOD-OD) task. This method uses two inverse processes to synthesize the phase information of unknown and known samples, respectively. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method.",
            "Strengths": "1. Gradual phase averaging: Instead of adding noise, MPD gradually performs Gaussian averaging on the phase of extracted features. This helps to prevent rapid loss of content in the phase, ensuring that important information is preserved during the process.\n   2. Experimental superiority: MPD has demonstrated superior performance in various tasks, including OOD-OD, incremental object detection, and open-set object detection. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the MPD method in promoting safe deployment of object detectors.",
            "Weaknesses": "The idea of replacing Gaussian noise in the diffusion process with Gaussian average operation seems to be an experimental result, lacking theoretical explanation and formula derivation.",
            "Questions": "1. Why choose to generate phase instead of the original image or amplitude? What are the phase advantages?   2. Why choose a 5x5 kernel for the Gaussian average? Has the author tried other types or sizes of kernels?   3. If Gaussian noise is replaced by the Gaussian average, is the diffusion model still valid? Can you provide the formula derivation?   4. The description of the OOD phase in Figure 2 is confusing, the meaning of approximately equal and not equal symbols is unclear.   5. What are the shortcomings of this method? Does its training and reasoning time have any advantages compared to previous methods?",
