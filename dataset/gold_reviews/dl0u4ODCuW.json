        "Metareview": "In this paper, the authors first propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of the proposed synthesis path. However, optimizing such a metric is computational intractable. Therefore, the authors proposed a heuristic searching algorithm, inspired by existing retro*, and conducted experiments to demonstrate the advantages.\n The paper is interesting and empirically promising.",
        "Justification For Why Not Higher Score": "There are several issues pointed out by the reviewers. The major concern is the discussion and comparison with the existing methods, e.g., retro*, DFPN-E, and FusionRetro, should be emphasized in main text to further position the method well in the literature.\n Although this has been provided in the revision, the novelty of the proposed method may not enough for a spotlight.",
        "Justification For Why Not Lower Score": "The proposed method is interesting and promising in practice."

            "Weaknesses": "* The reviewer has several questions explained in the Questions below.",
            "Questions": "1. On page 4. \"... while algorithms like breadth-first search or proof-number search (Kishimoto et al., 2019) have no customizable rewards or costs of any kind.\"   In Section 5. \"In fact, if costs are defined to be negative log probabilities then the updates for \u03c8 and \u03c1 are essentially equivalent to the \u201creaction number\u201d and \u201cretro* value\u201d updates from (Chen et al., 2020).\"   The reviewer could not find the key difference between retro-fallback and the two existing algorithms, DFPN-E [Kishimoto+ 2019] or Retro* [Chen+ 2020]. If we use the negative log probabilities as the proof or disproof number, retro- feedback, Retro*, and DFPN-E seem very similar.   Probably, the reviewer did not understand what this sentence meant. \"The key difference is that retro-fallback performs parallel updates...\"   What does \"parallel\" mean in this case? Could the authors elaborate on this part?\n   2. The reviewer might have misunderstood something, but the problem described in Section 4.1 could easily avoided if the authors used a hash table for implementing the search algorithms. (Using a hash table is a standard technique for proof-number search.) If a hash table is used, a cycle could be easily detected, so it is possible to avoid problems caused by the same molecule or reaction appearing multiple times in a path.\n   3. P. 1. \"Although existing algorithms may find multiple synthesis plans, they are generally not designed to do so, and there is no reason to expect the plans found will be suitable as backup plans (e.g. they may share steps with the primary plan and thereby fail alongside it).\"   The following paper proposes an AND-OR-tree-based search algorithm for retrosynthesis, which keeps enumerating (probably) all the synthetic routes one by one in the order of some preference.\n > Shibukawa, R., Ishida, S., Yoshizoe, K. et al.

            "Summary": "This paper aims to find multiple retrosynthesis plans to cope with the uncertainty of infeasible reactions or non-buyable molecules. To achieve this goal, the paper first presents a evaluation metric SSP to quantify the probability of at least one synthesis plan can work (judged by a feasibility and buyability model), and further designs a retrosynthetic planning algorithm retro-fallback that can greedily expand molecules to maximizes SSP, specially when all existing synthesis plans currently fail.",
            "Strengths": "1. The objective for addressing the uncertainty of infeasible reactions or non-buyable molecules is well-motivated and important in practice, and the paper laid out a clear and general formalism for this objective (e.g., feasibility, buyability, SSP);   2. The path from motivation to solution is well-paved, from trivial/straightforward solution to the proposed one, and discussed the connection to related work systematically;   3. The evaluation directly answers questions about the claims made by the paper.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. While I appreciate the general formulation and systematic discussion about planning algorithms, given the existence of retro*, the novelty and advantage of this work (e.g., performing parallel updates using multiple samples) is not that obvious to me. I would encourage adding more discussion when talking about detailed method.    2. Since this work focuses on multi-step retrosynthesis, related works [1] working on this should be discussed.\n [1] Liu, Songtao, et al. \"FusionRetro: molecule representation fusion via in- context learning for retrosynthetic planning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023.",
            "Questions": "1. How does Algorithm 1 generate multiple possible reaction graph for a target molecule?    2. Algorithm 1 could generate plan that is not a valid plan, e.g., when the algorithm terminates, there are still tip nodes in G'. To take such cases into consideration, can the authors also evaluate performance using two other metrics: the success rate as in Retro*, and the set-wise exact match accuracy as in FusionRetro?   3. How sensitive the method is to the number of samples when computing line 4-6 in Algorithm 1?   4. It is interesting to see retro-fallback with transformer can be more computational efficient, and the authors elaborate more on that (e.g., how to combine both for improvement)?",

            "Summary": "The submission has a clear description and clarifies that low-feasibility of retrosynthetic routes limit the real-world practicability in lab. The quantitative results and the comparison to prior methods may need to be clarified to support the statement of enhancing the generated route practicability.",
            "Strengths": "1. This paper draws an insight to the unperfect reactions by the one-step prediction model and redefined the buyability of real-world molecules.\n   2. This paper uses a novel approach based on stochastic processes to solve the retrosynthetic problem.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. More quantitative experimental results and baseline comparisons need to be clarified.\n   2. This paper has a solid motivation and a novel solution to perform the route planning but is limited by the proposed SSP metric. SSP attempts to calibrate the feasibility of chemical reactions. However, it will not perform better than a forward one-step prediction model since they are trained on the similar reaction dataset. Besides, SAScore is a trivial metric as it prefers unrealistic large carbon rings.",
            "Questions": "The quantitative results seem not adequate enough to support the findings, could the author present more quantitative results?",
