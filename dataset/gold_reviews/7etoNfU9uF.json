        "Metareview": "This work presents an end-to-end point-based Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for event-based action recognition. It can effectively process sparse event point cloud data with SNN and extract both global and local features with a streamlined singular structure. The proposed SpikePoint achieves state-of-the-art performance on four event-based action recognition datasets, with fewer parameters and more efficient computation.\n Strengths The reviewers generally found the method to be novel and interesting in its approach to handle event data using point cloud representation and further processing with SNN. The proposed method shows competitive performance in terms of accuracy, model size and efficiency.\n Weaknesses The explanation and presentation could be further improved.",
        "Justification For Why Not Higher Score": "Regarding event data as point cloud data for processing borrows much from point cloud processing, which is not that novel. The explanation and presentation could be further improved.",
        "Justification For Why Not Lower Score": "The reviewers generally found the method to be novel and interesting in its\napproach to handle event data using point cloud representation and further\nprocessing with SNN, which is validated through extensive experiments."

            "Summary": "This paper proposed a novel and efficient network approach for event based action recognition. The network leveraged spike neural network as backbone. The preprocessing of the events includes grouping, sampling and rate coding to feed in spike format. The grouping takes special consideration to avoid asymmetric information pass-through. The proposed approach also has shown improving the mean relative error and coefficient of variation.\n The SNN learns from both the point cloud centroids and the processed representations. The feature learning part contains both local and global feature extractors as well as residual connection to avoid weight explosion/vanishing.\n The approach has been tested on various datasets including small and large ones. The paper has also compared with SOTA methods for similar tasks.\n The proposed approach has significantly low power consumption, especially compared to other non SNN based networks. The results are strong and the advantages are salient.",
            "Strengths": "The paper has proposed several novel processing steps accompanied by theoretical derivations. The paper first looked at how to convert the events into SNN acceptable format. One of the issues is that directly normalizing delta positions will result in asymmetric information passthrough. The paper calibrated this offset by using the delta of the absolute values. In the SNN part, the paper incorporated residual learning modules to prevent weight explosion/vanishing.\n The performance of the proposal has been demonstrated on several datasets and has strong improvement over existing methods.",
            "Weaknesses": "I don't find notable weaknesses. I only find the proposed methods could also be extended to other relevant tasks, which this paper has deferred to future work. Otherwise, I think the paper results are pretty solid.",

For clarity in Table 1, it would be more efficient to consolidate all pertinent information within a single row.\n   4. Could you clarify the term \"Single-stream\"?

            "Summary": "The authors propose a spiking neural network that applies to event-driven camera output and is applied to action detection (agents moving in the visual scene). The authors show that their method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, but with significantly lower latency and energy consumption.",
            "Strengths": "The method is clearly presented in the paper and is built around the use of point clouds, which are used to represent events. The method uses a relatively classical global architecture that consists in extracting local features, in order to group them intermediately to form a representation that will be efficiently processed by a final classification layer. Overall, the paper is well written and the results are clearly presented.",
            "Weaknesses": "A major argument of the paper is to propose a method that deals directly with events that are constituted by the output of an event camera. The authors' argument is to be able to transform events into point clouds and thus improve network performance: \"SpikePoint, is an end-to-end point-based SNN architecture\". However, the figure shows that after the grouping and sampling stage, the information is transformed by coding the firing rate: \"The coordinate is converted into spikes by rate coding, and the results of action recognition are obtained by the local feature extractor, global feature extractor, and classifier in turn\". This point needs to be clearly justified, and in particular why isn't the temporal information kept precisely at this point in the processing process. Is that information rather represented in the previous stages?",
            "Questions": "In addition, I think the paper could be improved by the following points:\n   * Numerous methods have been developed in the past to study dynamic scenes, such as particle importance sampling, and in particular the \"condensation\" method by Isard and Blake. What parallels do you see between your method and these methods?   * In Table 7, you show that performance is optimal for a given number of time steps... What can you deduce from this result in relation to the complexity of the data representation?\n Minor:\n   * \"C represents the set of moments\" - you mean instants?   * The point \"A detailed derivation can be found in Appendix A.4, which describes how this connection solves the problem of backpropagation.\" is vaguely introduced, please describe minimally the method in the main text.   * The syntax of the paper did not allow me to fully follow all arguments. I have not taken this into account in my evaluation, but the authors should use a service, even an automatic one, that allows clarification of certain points. Fix for instance \"bionic neurons\" > \"biological neurons\" or vague statements like \"to harmoniously extract local...\", . Also check the sentence \"We do identity mapping by changing the residual module to the following equation in SNN refer (Hu et al., 2021; Fang et al., 2021a; Feng et al., 2022). And the coefficient \u03c3\u2032 (Il+m\u22121 + Sl ) in Eq. 29 of error propagation of the corresponding residual term is canceled.   * The LaTeX formatting of the paper could be improved. In particular, quotations in the text should be enclosed in parentheses, e.g. using `citep`. Text appearing in equations (\"erf\", \"clip\", \"centroid\", \"lif\", ...) should be formatted as text, e.g. using `\\text``.",
