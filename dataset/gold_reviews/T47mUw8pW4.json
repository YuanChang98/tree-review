    "Comment": "The theory in this paper is quite a significant improvement over the best\nknown bound, both because it is non-asymptotic, and because it removes\nnumerous assumptions. Unfortunately, the consensus among reviewers seems to be\nthat this work is more suited for submission at a mathematical venue, or a\nconference more focused on vision or graphics.\n\nBased on the reviews, one suggestion for future draft is to include some\nexperiments. For instance, authors can compute the medial axis of a non-smooth\nshape under perturbations, to show that it is indeed stable.",

            "Summary": "In this paper, the authors analyze the stability of the medial axis of a set S, when S is perturbed by a map that is lipschitz with lipschitz derivatives.\n This stability result is of interest in numerous applications in machine learning, such as astrophysics.\n The author's results improve upon an existing result by Chazal and Soufflet in a few ways:\n   1. The authors remove an assumption that the set S must be a piecewise smooth manifold; here they only require S to be closed and bounded.   2. They do not require pruning the medial axis.   3. Their result holds in high dimensions.",
            "Strengths": "I think the result is significant, and of interest to the neurips community. Compared to Chazal and Soufflet, I think another significant aspect of this result is that this result is quantitative whereas Chazal and Soufflet's result is only qualitative.",
            "Weaknesses": "I have some questions about how this paper's results compare to existing results, as well as about several aspects of the result (see below). These may not be considered weaknesses if the authors can address them.",
            "Questions": "I have the following questions regarding this result:\n   1. How significant is removing the manifold assumption? Even if a set is not smooth, can it not be made smooth via some infinitesimally small perturbation (e.g. a gaussian convolution)? Can the authors elaborate on the strength of their result in the context of an application? E.g. for the astrophysics image example, can we not simply smooth the image via a infinitesimal smoothing operation, and then apply Chazal and Soufflet?\n   2. Is there any existing quantitative bounds that the authors can compare to (even if assumptions differ)? If there are, how does the rate in Theorem 3.9 (line 212) compare to existing rates?\n   3. To double check, on line 212, as L_F -> 1, L_{DF}-> 0, epsilon_1 and epsilon_2 -> 0, C_L(r, L_F, L_{DF},eps_1,eps_2) -> 0, is that correct?\n   4. Can the authors give an interpretation of rch(S) defined on line 99? In particular, for a non-smooth S, can rch(S) be 0?\n   5. if rch(S)=0, the result due to Federer in Theorme 2.6 becomes vacuous. However, the result in Theorem 3.9 does not seem to depend on rch(S) at all, even though it crucially uses Federer's result. Can the authors explain why this is?",

            "Summary": "This work proves that the medial axis of closed sets is Hausdorff stable, this extends existing stability result on the stability of the medial axis of C^2 manifolds under C2 ambient diffeomorphisms. The contributions are\n   1. This work makes no assumptions of the set except the closedness. The stability of the medial axis of smooth manifolds has been intensively studied in the literature, this work omits the manifold assumption.\n   2. The stability is achieved without pruning the medial axis. Large body of works have to prune the medial axis.\n   3. The stability results hold for sets in arbitrary dimensions and are insensitive to the dimension of the set itself.\n This theoretical result plays a fundamental role in many fields, the generalization is important to many practical applications.",
            "Strengths": "The theoretic results are much general, it doesn't require the manifold assumption, it doesn't need to prune the medial axis, the results hold for any dimensions.\n The work is clearly represented.

The stability result is established with respect to smooth diffemorphisms of the ambient space, is the bounding sphere preserving condition intrinsically essential or technically necessary ? To what extent, one can remove this restriction ?\n   2. Suppose the set S is a C2 surface, if S is deformed to generate a curvature singularity, the surface becomes C1 at the singularity, the medial axis may change drastically. Please explain why the ambient diffeomorphism C^{1,1} can avoid this situation.\n   3. For the conjecture, the cut locus is closely related to the sign of the Gaussian curvature on the surface. Small perturbation changing the sign of the curvature may generate conjugate points suddenly. From this point of view, it seems the stability of cut locus may be hard to achieve. Please explain your insights for the conjecture.",
            "Limitations": "The current stability result assumes the diffeomorphisms is a small perturbation of the identity, and it preserves the bounding sphere. This constraint seems to be artificial and inconvenient for practical applications. Maybe this requirement can be weakened or the bounding sphere is pushed to infinity.",

The authors develop a notion of stability for such sets with respect to ambient diffeomorphisms of Rd. The main result proves stability with respect to C1,1 diffeomorphisms under additional assumptions about the set S (for instance, that S is bounded, See Assumption 3.8 for a full list.) This result is considered a generalization of an earlier result, which makes stronger smoothness assumptions (namely C2) on both the set S and the class of ambient diffeomorphisms. The authors argue in the early parts of the paper that this extra generality is needed for (unspecified) applications in astrophysics.",
            "Strengths": "The expository style in the early parts of the paper is inviting, where it does a good job of illustrating some basic notions, including familiar ones such as the medial axis and less-familiar ones like the generalized tangent space.",
            "Weaknesses": "There are a few different criticisms one can make of this paper:\n   1. The topic is niche for a NeuRIPS audience.   2. The main result is technical and difficult for non-experts to verify.   3. The main result, as described in the introduction, is a marginal improvement over the current state of the art in reference [13], in the sense that one gains only less restrictive assumptions about the regularity of the functions and shape that appear.   4. The connection to applications is tenuous at best, and no experiments are provided.\n With regards to 1 and 2 above, let me draw attention to the statement of the main result in Theorem 3.9 and the preceding assumptions it requires, which take nearly a page to write down even with many prerequisite definitions that appear before it. One would at least hope based on the promises of the introduction that a simple definition of \"stability\" would be available for use in the statement of the theorem. With regards to 3 and 4, there is very little given to convince the reader that the C2 results are insufficient for applications.\n I would not necessarily suggest that a paper with one or more of these deficiencies be excluded from NeuRIPS. However, given that all four issues are present, it seems better to focus on resolving some of them, or to send the paper to another venue (eg. a pure mathematics journal) where some of these criteria are judged to be less important.",
            "Questions": "It would be very helpful for readers to point out where to find your main result early on in the introduction. That would be Theorem 3.9, right?\n lines 112: I don't understand why the assumption S and its medial axis being bounded is not a further restriction needed to state your result. There is nothing in Remark 2.1 that addresses the case of an unbounded set S, nor anywhere else in the paper. Moreover, these assumptions do appear in the statement before Theorem 3.9. Thus, it seems incorrect for you to state your theorem in the introduction simply for \"closed sets\" without further qualification.",

I am a first-time reviewer hence will reassess my thoughts given other reviewers' input, but in a sense, placing the proofs in the supplementary is a somewhat odd choice to me, as the paper is a completely theoretical paper with its crux being the proofs themselves. Additionally, I find the theorem somewhat esoteric, being both a slight extension of Chazal and Soufflet, and requiring the ambient deformation preserve a bounded sphere to only yield a lipschitz bound.
