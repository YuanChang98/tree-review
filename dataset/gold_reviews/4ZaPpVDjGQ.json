            "Summary": "In a federated setting where a server coordinates the collaborative analysis of multiple users with local data, communication efficiency and data privacy are two major issues of consideration. Classical DP mechanisms such as Laplace or Gaussian mechanisms add noises as real numbers -- at the same time, to save communication cost it is preferred to have discrete noises with limited range (resolution). This paper considers all three aspects: communication efficiency, privacy, and accuracy. Specifically, the authors would like to study privacy guarantee of data compression schemes, which intuitively introduces information loss and thus is good for protecting privacy.\n The authors use f-DP, and considers binomial mechanisms. Binomial mechanisms have been considered in [6] and [9], this paper provides tighter bounds. In addition, the authors also consider a compression scheme that optimizes for communication efficiency. This is a combination of a sign based quantization and sparsification.",
            "Strengths": "I like the motivation of the paper and the consideration of all three objectives, communication efficiency, privacy and accuracy together. The tighter analysis and mechanisms for communication efficiency is of use in practice.\n Although the work builds on prior work the improvement by considering compression for privacy amplification is nice. The paper is generally well written.",
            "Weaknesses": "A few minor issues, see below.",
            "Questions": "Are there any lower bounds on the tradeoff of the three considerations? Any discussion here would be useful.\n Writing: it would be good to summarize somewhere in the paper the best recommendation for practitioners, what parameters to choose etc.\n Is there general improvement (amplification of privacy) using compression/sparsification? Can the authors elaborate/discuss this?",

            "Summary": "This paper analyses the privacy that is provided by stochastic rounding methods when doing distributed mean estimation with local differential privacy. It finds that they can contribute to the privacy guarantee thus achieving a better tradeoff.\n It then \"breaks\" the privacy communication utility trade-off in the sense of pointing out that for the high privacy regime extra communication won't buy you any more accuracy.",
            "Strengths": "Previous naive means of implementing DP aggregation with randomised rounding have failed to take advantage of the privacy provided by stochastic compression. This should be utilised if possible which they attempt to do.",
            "Weaknesses": "The presentation fails to show a decent comparison showing hwo much is really gained by taking advantage of this randomness. It isn't clear the gain isn't negligible. There is a graph comparing ternary and binary quantisation but it isn't clear whether the parameters actually correspond to low communication, which would require sufficient sparsity.\n The supposed break of the three way trade off is really just the observation that in the high privacy regime there is no gain to lots of communication. This is not what break means, the title is overselling.\n What is more this observation is very far from new. The idea that O(epsilon) communication suffices goes back a long way for various problems. This was proven with complete generality in <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12099.pdf>.",
            "Questions": "Fixing two of privacy/communication/utility how much does taking advantage of the randomness in the compression actually help the other one?\n Am I missing something with the breaking of the trade-off?",

            "Summary": "This paper investigates the f-DP guarantee of several discrete-valued mechanisms in the local-DP model. In particular, closed-form expressions for binomial noise mechanism and Binomial mechanics are derived.\n Then, the paper considers the popular problem of aggregating d-dimensional vectors from local users subject to privacy communication constraints. Under the f-DP framework, this paper presents a new \"ternary\" mechanism and analyzes its f-DP privacy guarantee. Roughly, the ternary mechanism allows each local user to sparsify their vectors by keeping each coordinate with only a small probability and adding noises to the alive coordinates. The hope is that by sparsification and randomization, one can optimize communication (i.e., minimizing the messages from each user to the server) and privacy cost (e.g., each user has its signal \"somewhat hidden\" in the noises).\n The paper's main claim is that, by working with f-DP and the ternary mechanism, we can benefit in **both** privacy and communication by the sparsification process in the ternary mechanism. Intuitively, if the sparsifying threshold is high (i.e., we only keep very few coordinates), we can hope to add less noise to achieve privacy, as the sparsification has already introduced some uncertainty in the data. The paper claims that this is something that prior works cannot offer. The reviewer, unfortunately, did not have a chance to verify the claim.",
            "Strengths": "* Working with f-DP **and** in the local model seems like a new approach.   * The proposed algorithm is natural and simple to implement, it is backed by the theory and performs favorably in the experiments.",
            "Weaknesses": "* It's a bit hard to interpret/digest the closed-form f-DP guarantee of all these mechanisms. Have some plot/converting to Renyi-DP or (eps,delta)-DP might help.",
            "Questions": "* Your algorithm sends **in expection** O(d * A/B) bits. Is there a way to improve this to a worst-case guarantee? How about, say, randomly selecting (A/B * d) coordinates? Is it possible to work out the f-DP (or any other reasonable DP notion) property of this variant?",

            "Summary": "This paper studies distributed mean estimation under privacy and communication constraints. This paper focuses on characterizing the recently defined notion of $f$-DP for communication-efficient mechanisms, where $f$-DP can be converted to the standard $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP. The paper analyzed the $f$-DP of different known mechanisms in the literature. Furthermore, a new algorithm named ternary compression is proposed.",
            "Strengths": "The distributed mean estimation is an important topic and has lots of applications in federated learning under privacy and communication constraints. The presentation is well written.",
            "Weaknesses": "Although the topic is interesting, my main concerns are about the contributions of this paper.\n   * The first part of the paper is to analyze the $f$-DP of well-known discrete mechanisms. While analyzing the $f$-DP is useful, it is not hard to compute it. I don't know what are the major challenges in this analysis and if this analysis provides any new insights into analyzing the $f$-DP. Hence, in my opinion, this part isn't novel enough as a main contribution of this paper.\n   * The expressions of the $f$-DP are not in a closed form; the expressions are functions of a set of probabilities that might be computationally expensive to compute for large system parameters.\n   * The proposed mechanism of ternary compression is not novel. There are lots of similar schemes that don't send some coordinates with some probability from sampling the coordinates for example [13] and [23]. Actually, the Ternary mechanism can be seen as a combination of CLDP for a set of coordinates that are chosen i.i.d. with probability $B/A$. \n   * In general, this ternary mechanism has higher privacy because it has lower accuracy, since with some non-zero probability (when $B>A$), the client will not send anything. \n   * The optimal trade-offs between privacy, communication, and accuracy have already been characterized for LDP in different works in the literature, and hence, I don't understand what is the major difference in this paper in comparison with the existing work.\n   * Typos: please define the abbreviation of GDP (Gaussian differential privacy) for using it. In Algorithm 1, $x_i\\in\\lbrace 0,1,\\ldots,l \\rbrace$ instead of square brackets. Figure 4 is small and the lines are close enough so that it is hard to distinguish the different mechanisms.",
            "Questions": "* It is mentioned in the abstract and also in the introduction that _it remains an open problem whether such discrete-valued mechanisms provide any privacy protection._ I don't know which open problem the authors referring to. If it is the distributed mean estimation under jointly local differential privacy and communication constraints, then this problem is already solved in the literature.\n   * In line 51, _SQKR doesn't account for the privacy introduced during sparsification._ I don't understand this part. AFAIK, SQKR is order optimal, and hence, it doesn't lose privacy analysis. \n   * In lines 259-261, what do these numbers of $\\epsilon$ refer to, and from where it comes?\n   * In lines 331-333, _we essentially remove the dependency of accuracy on the communication overhead._ Could you please explain more? In general, it is supposed that there is a trade-off between communication and accuracy, so the accuracy depends on the communication budget.",
