            "Summary": "The paper studied time series forecasting problem for weather forecasting, energy consumption, and financial assessment. To propose a model that generalizes on varying distribution, the authors proposed Koopa which is composed of modular Koopman predictors to describe and advance forward series dynamics. The motivation is Koopman-based methods are appropriate to learn non-stationary time series dynamics. The implementation is straightforward in the supplement material. The experimental results show the effective performance of the proposed methods compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
            "Strengths": "The paper proposed a novel method to solve the time series forecasting problem. The introduction of Koopa Block is interesting. The experimental results show that the model outperforms existing methods with more efficient memory usage.",
            "Weaknesses": "It is interesting to see more analysis about Koopa blocks. For example on Figure 5, authors showed the visualized blocks are different which corresponds to different curves. But it is clear that the curves of K1, K2, and K2 share the similarity that they goes down first, then goes up. It is interesting to see the correlation analysis if there is some.\n The experiments show the proposed method achieved better performance with efficient training time and memory usage. I am not sue if there is convergence analysis and what are the parameters, such as the number of epochs for training, batch size.",
            "Questions": "1. Is there any correlation between Koopa blocks if the curves share similarity as shown in Figure 5 ?   2. How is the convergence of the proposed method and compared methods?   3. What are the parameters, such as the number of epochs for training, batch size for experiments?",
            "Limitations": "There is no theoretical analysis but the main contribution is to propose a novel architecture.",

            "Summary": "This paper addresses non-stationary time series forecasting, in which case the temporal distribution of time series is changing over time. Koopman theory is introduced in this paper for its fundamental capacity on modeling dynamical systems and a Koopman forecaster called Koopa is proposed. Concretely, in this paper, time series is disentangled into time-variant and time-invariant components. For time-invariant component, Koopa introduces a learnable matrix as Koopman operator, and for time-variant component, Koopa leverages eDMD to find the best fitted matrix that advances forward the system. The proposed framework is technically sound but somewhat lacks novelty.",
            "Strengths": "1. Non-stationary time series forecasting is challenging and it is reasonable to apply Koopman theory to tackle this task.   2. Disentangling time series into variant and invariant components is intuitive.   3. The methods of constructing Koopman operators for both time-variant and -invariant components are straightforward.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. The proposed model lacks novelty. Both disentangling time series and applying Koopman theory are commonly used techniques in time series analysis.    2. The technical contribution of this paper is limited. The extraction of time variant and invariant components is too simple and lacks analysis. The application of Koopman theory is simply the construction of Koopman operators.   3. Hierarchically disentangling time series lacks intuition and motivation. What's the point of further disentangle variant component into invariant and variant components?   4. The experiment does not involve highly non-stationary datasets.   5. Koopman operators are highly correlated to measurement functions. In the branch of time variant component, although the model constructs diverse Koopman operators, the measurement, i.e., the encoder, is static. For more technical contributions, a deeper integration of Koopman's theory is needed.",

            "Summary": "The authors address the issue that most real-world time-series are non- stationary. To tackle this problem they introduce Koopa, a globally learned (time-invariant) and localized (time-variant) linear Koopman operators, to exploit respective dynamics underlying different components. In practice, Koopa is composed of stackable Koopa Blocks, where each block learns operators hierarchically by taking the residual of previous block fitted dynamics as input. The authors evaluate the proposed model on variety of time-series data sets and compare their method with transformer and convolution based deep architectures. Koopa outperforms or performs on par with the existing methods, yet has a significantly lower computational costs. Moreover, the proposed method can be use in settings where the forecast horizon must be increased beyond the training set-up.",
            "Strengths": "Originality: The related work section in well written. It covers both relevant model types in the field, for (a) time series forecasting, TCN, RNN and transformers are mentioned, as well as the authors position the current work in its context; for (b) Koopman operators, the authors provide an overview of the related work and how their work differs. The work proposes a novel method leveraging Fourier analysis to disentangle time-series components, eDMD for estimating time-variant Koopman Predictor, and time-invariant Koopman Prediction as a learnable parameter. It differentiates itself from KAEs due to its block like structure, where the residual of the previous block is fed as input into the next block.\n Quality: The submission is techinncally sound. The authors build upon Koopman operator theory and Wold's Theorem. In addition, experimentally they validate whether their proposed sub-components of Koopa, Fourier Filter, truly disentangles time-variant from time-invariant series. As well as provide an ablation on Koopa structure.\n Clarity: The work is well written providing sufficient relevant background knowledge on Koopman operator theory also for reader who is unfamiliar with this theory.\n Significance: The obtained results are significant. The proposed method outperforms or performs on par with existing time-series forecasting methods. More importantly, the method is very efficient with respect to training time and memory costs compared to transformer or convolution based methods. Lastly, the authors showcase that their method is applicable for scaling up forecast horizon, where standard deep learning architectures fail. In all, based on the submission the author's suggest a very promising modelling technique, however, I am not an expert of Koopman operator theory (nor the works in this sub- domain).",
            "Weaknesses": "Clarity: When first mentioned, I would recommend using the complete name of the model type rather than only the acronym, for example, temporal convolutional network rather than just TCN, it makes it easier for the reader to read.",

            "Summary": "This work propose a new architecture inspired by Koopman theory for time- series forecasting task. To address the non-stationarity problem, this work follow the idea of disentangle local and global time-series representation and forecasting model respectively. Particularly, this work propose to use Fourier filter on long sequence to extract more robust and stable patterns for global model and Koopa Block to hierarchically disentangle local and global representation in a residual structure. The proposed method achieves competitive performance when comparing with recent baselines.",
            "Strengths": "1. The structure is well organized. Figures 2 and 3 provide a clear visual representation of how the proposed method works.\n   2. The experiments are comprehensive. The proposed method can beat the recent method PatchTST on the commonly used long sequence forecasting benchmark.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. Although the paper's title revolves around the Koopman theory, the proposed method is generic and not closely related to it. From my understanding, most of technique contributions lie in how to extract local and global representation and design forecasting model for non-stationary time-series. The work solely follow the the conclusion of Koopman theory and model the latent dynamic with linear transition model. \n   2. Technique novelty is limited. The general idea of using local and global presentation/model to tackle non-stationary time-series tasks has been used. This work builds upon these foundations and introduces several modifications by integrating some other methods used in recent deep time series forecasting, like residual block, Fourier filter.\n   3. Section 1 needs improvements. It is clear for me how Koopman operator address the non-linear dynamics, but section 1 does not clearly show how existing work of Koopman theory tackle non-stationary problems. Could the authors elaborate more on line 40-42? In line 52-54, could the authors explain the motivation of replacing reconstruction loss? In line 30-31, the authors introduce \"Non-stationary ...... in different periods\". However, the proposed method do not show the capability to detect period boundary.\n   4. The experiments are comprehensive, but it would be better to design experiments revolve around the topic and the proposed method. Ablation studies can successfully validate the effectiveness of the design of local and global model, but the experiment associated time and memory cost analysis might lose focus. The authors can also explore the effect of number of block to verify the capability of hierarchical disentanglement. \n   5. It would be better to discuss the related work of non-stationary time series forecasting, like regime switching state-space models, time-varying state-space models, etc.",

            "Summary": "This paper tackles the task of non-stationary time series forecasting with Koopman operator. Specifically, the authors propose Koopa Blocks, which uses Fourier transform to disentangle the time series into time-variant and time- invariant components, and leverages Koopman operator to model their dynamics respectively. The method is evaluated on six real-world benchmark datasets.",
            "Strengths": "1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.   2. This study represents a pioneering endeavor in integrating Fourier transform and Koopman theory, with the aim of disentangling time-variant and time-invariant components within the Fourier spectral domain. The idea is both innovative and thought-provoking, setting a precedent for future investigations into the research of deep Koopman methods.   3. The additional \"Scaling Up Forecast Horizon\" experiments demonstrate that Koopa is capable of accurately forecasting in situations involving length mismatches or long-term scenarios. In the realm of the Koopman method, these long-term prediction results are exceptional.   4. The proposed model is memory and time efficient compared to previous methods.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. The performance improvement of univariate forecasting is incremental. Also, the improvement of multivariate forecasting is also not so significant under most cases.   2. The essence of the deep Koopman method lies in the spectrum of the Koopman operator, because the eigenvalues determine the model's behavior during long-term evolution. However, the author did not provide any analysis or visualized results regarding the eigenvalues. This lead to the following issues:\n   * Given the considerable forecasting length (up to 192 in this case), it is remarkable how the model manages to achieve accurate predictions without encountering issues such as explosion or decay during the forward pass. Is it true that all the eigenvalues of the system have a modulus of one, ensuring stable and non-divergent behavior throughout the prediction process?    * Intuitively, it would be expected that the time-variant Koopman operator possesses more eigenvalues with larger phase angles compared to the time-invariant operator. I wonder whether this is true in this case. What does the spectrum for these two operator looks like?",
