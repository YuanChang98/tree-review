    "Comment": "This paper introduces a deep-learning based method for RNA secondary structure\nprediction with pseudoknots that enforces validity of the prediction (each\nbase is paired to only one other base). Reviewers thought the method was\ninteresting and had good performance, but had concerns about novelty and\nexperimental results (in particular generalization performance, inference time\nevaluation and separate evaluation on pseudoknots). The authors provided\ncomprehensive responses that addressed these issues to some extent, but issues\nregarding generalization performance of the proposed method and novelty\nremained after the discussion.\n\nOverall, while the method is promising, the paper will require major revisions\nto address the issues highlighted by reviewers. In particular, the AC agrees\nthat proper evaluation of the method in cross-family experiments and\ndiscussion of its limitations is critical to provide a realistic view of the\nmethod's performance. As such, the current version of the paper misses the bar\nfor NeurIPS. That being said, the paper has potential and the AC encourages\nthe authors to revise and resubmit it to a different venue.",

            "Summary": "The paper proposes RFold, a simple and effective RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm. It adopts attention maps to learn informative representations for RNA rather than hand-crafted features. Then, based on a decoupled optimization process, RFold simplifies and guarantees satisfying the hard constraints on the formation of RNA secondary structure. Through the empirical experiments, the authors demonstrate that RFold achieves state-of- the-art performance with better computational efficiency compared to the previous works.",
            "Strengths": "* The proposed decoupled optimization seems simple, but surprisingly effective for RNA secondary structure prediction. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed method is novel in the domain and might be promising for the broader machine-learning community.   * The proposed method shows great performance in three RNA benchmark datasets outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method by a significant margin. Some issues need to be addressed regarding the experiment setup (please refer to the weaknesses), but the improved performance seems truly impressive.",
            "Weaknesses": "Major comments:\n   * [Data Split] To best approximate real-world applications that may require the prediction of novel structures, RNAs from the train/val/test set should bear minimal sequence and structural similarities. In contrast, it seems the authors have split datasets so that each RNA family has a similar fraction in each set. I think it may overestimate the true prediction performance of RFold. Likewise, \u201cgeneralization to other datasets\u201d experiments do not provide information about sequence/structure similarities between the datasets. If they are similar, it may not be a fair evaluation of generalization performance.   * Since the authors stated deep learning methods do not ignore the biologically essential structure such as pseudoknots, can you provide additional separate evaluation under the (non-) existence of pseudoknots?   * According to UFold, the bpRNA dataset contains mostly within family RNA species and does not adequately show the true generalization performance of the models. Can you provide additional evaluations with cross-family experiments?   * [Inference Time] It\u2019s unclear whether the results are credible. The inference time can be quite different based on what type of machine (CPU, GPU, etc.) is used for the measurement. Since the other results seem to be excerpted from the UFold paper, the environments of UFold and RFold are likely to be different.   * [Reproduciblity] Architectural hyperparameters are missing. In addition, training codes do not seem to be included in the supplementary.\n Minor comments:\n   * [Data Split] The authors stated that they split the RNAStralign dataset following the E2Efold paper. Can you confirm that all the methods including RFold used the same data splits? RNA sequences often have high sequence and structure similarities, so if you used different data splits it might affect the performance.    * As the authors stated, other algorithms often post-process the outputs to satisfy the constraints. Can you also show how the results are improved for RFold-E/S with the post-processing?",
            "Questions": "* Do you have any plans for launching a web server for the proposed method? It would be difficult for many biotechnology researchers to set up the environment and run the algorithm. Therefore, while it is not mandatory, most compared algorithms support web servers for their models.",
            "Limitations": "The authors have not discussed the limitations of the work.\n \\---Post-Rebuttal Comments---\n I appreciate the authors' dedication evident in their comprehensive responses. They have effectively addressed many of the concerns I had about the paper. Overall, while some concerns persist, I am inclined to believe that by incorporating the authors' responses, the manuscript's quality would be improved. Hence, I've adjusted my rating to 5.",

            "Summary": "This work presents an efficient and accurate approach for end-to-end RNA secondary structure prediction. The optimization problem formulation and its solution are well defined. The results are strong and supported by visualizations and ablation studies.",
            "Strengths": "The key strengths of this work are:\n   1. Inference is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods.   2. Inference is between 4-20% more accurate than previous methods, with significant gains specifically in long-range interactions.   3. A well defined optimization problem formulation and solution.   4. Including visualizations and ablation studies underscores the gains achieved through the optimization formulation and attention architecture.   5. The results are validated using multiple datasets and baselines.",
            "Weaknesses": "Weaknesses of this work are:\n   1. There is a discrepancy in the definition of G in equation 12, where it does not incorporate the softmax function. However, in equation 15, it is assumed as if it does. This can be fixed by introducing a new notation, such as G_{hat}, which includes the softmax function and will ensure consistency.   2. The definition of well-known metrics in section 5 is redundant.   3. The comparison between Rfold and Ufold could be more comprehensive, describing their similarities and differences.   4. There are a few minor typos, and the writing may be improved.",

            "Summary": "The paper introduces RFold for RNA secondary structure prediction (a prediction of LxL binary matrix). It proposes to add a row-column-wise softmax at output of the model, before computing the L2 loss with respect to the ground truth. The experimental results show higher precision and recall compared to prior works.",
            "Strengths": "* The paper is well-written with necessary backgrounds and basic introductions, problem formulations. Thus, this paper suited well for general audience of NeurIPS.   * RFold delivers strong performances in two commonly used datasets for evaluating RNA secondary structures.",
            "Weaknesses": "The main concern is the limited novelty, RFold is incremental over Ufold. Both methods follow the paradigm of mapping a sequence RNA (using \u03b81) to [L\u00d7L\u00d7n] features and further mapping the [L\u00d7L\u00d7n] features (using \u03b82) to [L\u00d7L\u00d71] output prediction. RFold differs from Ufold in two parts:\n   * RFold proposes \u03b81 to be represented by an attention-based layer. (RFold and Ufold use a similar, if not identical, \u03b82.)   * RFold adds a column-wise and a row-wised softmax after the \u03b82, before computing L2 loss.\n Thus, RFold makes a few architectural modifications and improves the results.\n E2Efold and Ufold also have a section on evaluation with pseudoknots on the RNAStralign test dataset, which this submission does not have.",

            "Summary": "In this paper, the authors propose a way to decouple the optimization process of RNA secondary structure prediction. Specifically, they decompose the constraint satisfaction problem into row-wise and column-wise optimization. Instead of hand-crafted features, attention maps are used to learn the pair- wise interactions of the nucleotide bases.",
            "Strengths": "1. The authors show that it is more effective to use the attention maps as the input and then use U-Net to predict H, compared with using the hand-crafted features as input, which is interesting.   2. The proposed method reduces the inference time dramatically compared to various methods.   3. It achieves promising results on the RNAStralign dataset and large-scale benchmark evaluation.",
            "Weaknesses": "1. The generalization ability is limited because the proposed method cannot achieve the best recall on ArchiveII and bpRNA-TS0 datasets.",
            "Questions": "Could the authors use experiments to show that strict constraints cause the less promising generalization ability? Is it possible to improve the proposed method to gain better generalization ability?",
